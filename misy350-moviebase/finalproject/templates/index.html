    <h4>This is Melissa Strab's final project for MISY350 at the University of Delaware!</h4>
    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Project Description:</h5>
    <p>The database I created is a movie database that holds both actors
    and movies.  It allows users to add, edit, and delete actors from a table as
    well as add, edit, and delete movies from a table.  These features are enabled
    through forms and extensions from a base webpage.  Each page shares the same
    format and navigation bar on the top of the page.</p>
    <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Table Descriptions:</h5>
    <p>I have created two tables: one for the Actors and one for the Movies. The
      columns in the Actors table are: name, about.  The columns in the Movies
      table are: name, year, actor.  It is a one to many relationship because one
      actor can be involved with many movies.  The actor field in the movies table
      links the two tables together.  (see README.md file for more detail)  </p>
